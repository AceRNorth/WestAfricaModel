# WestAfricaModel

A model to simulate mosquito populations in West Africa

The scripts in this repository were written to study genetic (gene-drive) methods of controlling mosquito vectors of malaria, as desribed in Hancock, P.A, North, A et al.

Installation

CM.cpp is a c++ code for a simulation model of mosquito population dynamics, accompanied by the header file head.h. To run the model, download these source files and compile them locally (though we cannot guarentee they are compatible with all compilers). Alternatively, you may download RunModel, a compiled executable version of the c++ code, compiled with The Intel(R) C++ Compiler Classic (ICC) (version 2021.9.0). RunModel has been compiled and tested on a linux desktop computer.

Usage

The simulation begins by inputing numerous parameters and input data
